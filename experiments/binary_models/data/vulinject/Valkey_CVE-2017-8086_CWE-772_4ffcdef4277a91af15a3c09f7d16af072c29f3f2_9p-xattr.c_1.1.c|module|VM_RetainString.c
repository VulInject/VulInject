         * call at the end to bring the refcount back at the desired
         * value? Because this way we ensure that the object refcount
         * value is 1 (instead of going to 2 to be dropped later to 1)
         * after the call to this function. This is needed for functions
         * like ValkeyModule_StringAppendBuffer() to work. */
