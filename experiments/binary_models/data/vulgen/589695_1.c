for ( in * libc / port / locale ; ) { . However , there are some other tidbits : * * a ; } The substitution entries are now a directly indexable array . A * priority elsewhere in the table is taken as an index into the * substitution table it has a high bit ( COLLATE_SUBST_PRIORITY ) * set . ( The bit is cleared and the result is the index into the * table . * * b ) We eliminate duplicate entries into the substitution table . * This saves a lot of space . * * c , ; This means sort levels * which only have a few distinct priorities can represent the * priority level in fewer bits , which makes the strxfrm output * smaller . * * d ; , For the UNDEFINED pass ( the last pass ) , we record the maximum * number of bits needed to uniquely prioritize these entries , so that * the last pass can also use smaller strxfrm output when possible . * * f , , , , , , , ,
