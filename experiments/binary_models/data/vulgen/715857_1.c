* This routine computes the DES key schedule given a key . The * permutations and shifts have been done at compile time , resulting * in a direct one - step mapping from the input key to the key * schedule . * * Also checks parity and weak keys . * * Watch out ; for , it is * passed as an arg . Also implies that caller has explicit control * over zeroing both the key schedule and the key . * * Originally written 6 / 85 by Steve Miller , MIT Project Athena . * / int mit_des_key_sched ( , ) { mit_des_make_key_sched ( k , schedule ) } ; if ( mit_des_is_weak_key ( k ) ) { return ( - 2 ) ; } return 0 ;
