    "CWE-119": "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer:  C/C++ allows direct addressing of memory locations and do not automatically ensure that these locations are valid for the memory buffer that is being referenced. This can cause read or write operations to be performed on memory locations that may be associated with other variables, data structures, or internal program data. As a result, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code, alter the intended control flow, read sensitive information, or cause the system to crash.",
    "CWE-189": "Integer overflow or underflow: If the resulting values after incorrect conversion between numeric types are used in a sensitive context, then dangerous behaviors may occur.",
    "CWE-476": "NULL Pointer Dereference: A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the application dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but is NULL, typically causing a crash or exit. A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the application dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but is NULL, typically causing a crash or exit. NULL pointer dereference issues can occur through a number of flaws, including race conditions, and simple programming omissions.",
    "CWE-416": "Use After Free: Referencing memory after it has been freed can cause a program to crash, use unexpected values, or execute code. The use of previously-freed memory can have any number of adverse consequences, ranging from the corruption of valid data to the execution of arbitrary code, depending on the instantiation and timing of the flaw. The simplest way data corruption may occur involves the system's reuse of the freed memory. Use-after-free errors have two common and sometimes overlapping causes:\n1. Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.\n2. Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for freeing the memory.\nIn this scenario, the memory in question is allocated to another pointer validly at some point after it has been freed. The original pointer to the freed memory is used again and points to somewhere within the new allocation. As the data is changed, it corrupts the validly used memory; this induces undefined behavior in the process.\nIf the newly allocated data happens to hold a class, in C++ for example, various function pointers may be scattered within the heap data. If one of these function pointers is overwritten with an address to valid shellcode, execution of arbitrary code can be achieved.",
    "CWE-772": "Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime: When a resource is not released after use, it can allow attackers to cause a denial of service by causing the allocation of resources without triggering their release. Frequently-affected resources include memory, CPU, disk space, power or battery, etc."
